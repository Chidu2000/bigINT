Big integer library in C++ is very robust for handling big size numbers in c++.
sqrt() gives squareroot of a number instead of involving much calculations.
pow() gives the any power of a number .
max(a,b) gives the maximum value among variables a,b.
min(a,b) gives the minimum value among variables a,b.
instead of writing bigint we now write int
Using biginteger , we can calculate factorial of 1000 easily ,without much calculations.
