Hey, I would like to add some points here.
BigInteger is a very robust library which could be used in c++.
Some functions like max(a,b),pow(),min(),avg(), are used to get complex calculations done easily.

suggestion on converting into big integer is to use , biginteger.valueOf(int) instead of integer.
We just need to download the zip file and,
need to extract the same in specified gcc ,or ,
it could also be done using command prompt




Advantages in the long run:-
-Much reduction in space allocation to complex calculations, thereby reducing space comlexity
-Time to execute programs will be reduced ,i.e time complexity would not be exponential
-Easy modifications of code will be encouraged
-Easy implementation,support for any range of data , reduced errors ,easy understandibility for programmers.
