### Contributions

Contributors are welcome!

Currently we have the minimal project setup, we will keep on improving the repository standards as soon as we progress.

We aim to build a library for C++ 17 or above for big integer support

- Feel free to give suggestions or point bugs by rasing issues

#### Required setup
- CMake 3.16.8 or above
- GCC 9
- C++ 17

Hey, I would like to add some points here.
BigInteger is a very robust library which could be used in c++.
Some functions like max(a,b),pow(),min(),avg(), are used to get complex calculations done easily.

suggestion on converting into big integer is to use , biginteger.valueOf(int) instead of integer.
We just need to download the zip file and,
need to extract the same in specified gcc ,or ,
it could also be done using command prompt

Advantages in the long run:-
Much reduction in space allocation to complex calculations, thereby reducing space comlexity
Time to execute programs will be reduced ,i.e time complexity would not be exponential
Easy modifications of code will be encouraged
Easy implementation,support for any range of data , reduced errors ,easy understandibility for programmers.
